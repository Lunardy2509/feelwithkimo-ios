# Kimo - Early Childhood Emotional Learning App

## Overview

Kimo is an early childhood learning app designed to help children ages 3–5 understand and manage emotions through storytelling and interactive play. 

Using the RULER framework (Recognize, Understand, Label, Express, and Regulate emotions), Kimo guides children and parents through engaging activities that make abstract emotional concepts easier to grasp.

## The Learning Experience

The app features immersive stories, hands-on mini-games, and supportive parent–child interactions to strengthen emotional bonding while building foundational emotional intelligence. Children learn by seeing, listening, moving, and responding—creating a complete learning experience that is both fun and meaningful.

## Key Features

* **Emotion-based Storytelling:** Narratives specifically tailored for young learners to introduce emotional concepts.
* **Interactive Activities:** Includes breathing exercises, clapping games, and block-based play to engage children physically and mentally.
* **Parent-Guided Learning:** Dedicated moments designed to reinforce bonding between parent and child.
* **High-Quality Production:** Features professional narration, a child-friendly UI, and polished animations.
* **Multi-Language Support:** Full support for English, Chinese (Simplified & Traditional), and Indonesian.

## Goal

Kimo aims to make emotional learning accessible, engaging, and enjoyable for every child and parent.
